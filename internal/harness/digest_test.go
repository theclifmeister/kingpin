// TestSeedDigest (#144): the boss on one pinned seed, sixty days, the
// whole world hashed at the end of every one of them. A change that
// moves any number, any day, fails here and names the first day it
// moved, so a stream shift (a draw added to the home stream, a sim
// slotted between two others, a seed roll moved) or a balance change
// reads as one diff and not as a dozen medians, and a shape change (a
// field moved, a constructor reshaped) that claims to be byte-for-byte
// the old run has a test that says so. The failure prints the new
// list to paste in: a PR that moves a number pins the new one and
// names the day and the reason.
//
// The digest walks the world by reflection in a fixed order (struct
// fields in declaration order, map keys sorted), hashing every
// exported value; a float is rounded to six decimals first, so the
// fused multiply-add an arm64 build is allowed to use (Go's spec
// permits it; amd64 does not) cannot move the hash between a laptop
// and CI while a real change to any number does.

// World.Incidents, RouteSetting.ClosedUntil, HeatState.FederalUntil and
// FederalDecay, LawState.SnapElection and DayReport.Incident; day 25 by

// Stats.Earned and Invested, Today.Invested; no number moved: the boss's
// first level comes after day 60 on this seed).
// Again for #42 (the bought law on LawState, Route.Bought, Today.Bribes
// and Checkpoints, six Stats added to the walk; no number moved: with
// those fields skipped the digest is 0ab8bc7's on all sixty days, the
// boss paying nobody). Again for #195 (World.Offshore and QuietDays,
// Today.Reserved, Laundering.Structured, Stats.Reserved and Fees; one
// number moves from day 1: QuietDays, the count of quiet days in a row,
// which every run keeps and nothing but Retire reads; the boss reserves
// nothing by day 60 on this seed, holding under a campaign's worth).
// Again for #227 (World.Reign added to the walk; no number moved: with
// the field skipped the digest is the list before it on all sixty days,
// the boss holding no reign by day 60 on this seed).
// Again for #228 (Law.Favours, Law.FavourOwed and Stats.Favours in the
// walk; no number moved: with the fields skipped the digest is the list
// before it on all sixty days, the boss paying nobody by day 60 here).
// Again for #229 (World.War in the walk; no number moved: with the
// field skipped the digest is the list before it on all sixty days, the
// boss declaring no war).
// Again for #231 (Stats.Taxed in the walk; no number moved: with the
// field skipped the digest is the list before it on all sixty days, the
// boss holding no city by day 60).
// Again for #233, by copy alone, on day 56: the report's opening line
// under TIER the night the rival's push on the boss's front line was
// held off (World.Report is in the walk); with the report set aside the
// digest is the list before it on all sixty days, on both trees, and no

// Again for #43 (the table, on the duel's dice, harness.OneFaction:
// World.Rival became the slice World.Rivals of one, RivalState gained
// Home, Grudges, Trusts, Ally, Against, LostToYou, LastTakenBy,
// Absorbed, AbsorbedBy, Fragmented and Fragments, Deal, Offer,
// ScoutOrder, PoachOrder and Lead a Faction, CrewMember a Former and
// four Stats; the move is on day 1 by shape alone and no number moved:
// cmd/balance -factions 1 prints main's trace to the dollar on every
// day of five policies over three seeds, TestOneFactionIsTheOldRun).
// Again for #48 (World.Assets and AssetsLost, Today.AssetsBought,
// HeatState.TaskForceDay, WatchUntil, LineUntil and LineMul,
// Supplier.Owned, ShockUntil and ShockMul, six Stats added to the walk;
// one number moves from day 1: Stats.PeakClean, the clean high-water
// mark the assets unlock on, a copy of a maximum every run already
// held; and the report's tier lines reword twice, `tier 2 of 5` on day
// 2 and tier 4's `Next` on day 54, the day this seed enters
// Distribution; with those set aside the digest is aea739e's on all
// sixty days before #43 and 8b22ab1's after it, so no money number
// moved: TestNoAssetIsTheOldRun reads the same day by day to the
// tier-4 checkpoint; re-pinned on the merged tree).
// Again for #194 (Corner.Deed, Today.DeedsBought, Law.Forfeited and
// four Stats; the move is on day 1 by shape alone and no number moved:
// the boss buys its first deed after day 100 on this seed, and
// cmd/balance -deeds off prints 74a0b60's trace to the dollar on boss,

// the boss's trace holding to day 125 at the earliest).
// Again for #45 (World.Intel, Today.Cop and Spy, CrewMember.Undercover
// and UndercoverDay, DayReport.Intel and eight Stats added to the walk,
// RivalState.Known taken out of it and SchemaVersion 16; the move is on
// day 1 by shape alone and no number moved: with those fields set aside
// on both sides the digest is dff4a0a's on all sixty days, the boss
// paying no cop and planting nobody, and the facts the night writes off
// its own events living in Intel alone).
// Again for #49 (World.LegitDays, Ending.Who and Stats.Score added to
// the walk; the move is on day 1 by shape alone and no number moved:
// with the three fields skipped the digest is 2be03a7's on all sixty
// days, the boss's legit income under zero and nothing ending, and
// cmd/balance prints 2be03a7's trace to the dollar on boss, laundered
// and distributor to day 200, TestNoEndingIsTheOldRun).
// Again for #342 (DilemmaState.Owes added to the walk; the move is on
// day 1 by shape alone and no number moved: with the field skipped the
// digest is the list before it on all sixty days, the digest's run
// answering no card).
// Again for #358 (Card.Hide added to the walk; the move is on day 5,
// the first morning a card is pending, by shape alone and no number
// moved: with the field skipped the digest is the one before on all
// sixty days).
// Again for #351 (the report's cash flow, World.Flows and
// DayReport.Flow, which the walk leaves out, unwalked): days 9, 24, 26
// and 47 move by the report's words alone, a robbery's MONEY line
// naming the corner and the city (`Robbed on Riverside in Eastside`)
// where it read `Robbed on the corner`; days 57 to 60 by its numbers,
// the lieutenant's skim no longer counted twice (once off
// LieutenantActed and again inside the night's CrewSkimmed, so day 57's
// MISSING FROM THE COUNT read $188 for $94 and CASH BEFORE sat $94
// high; the flow reconciling pile by pile is what found it). No number
// moved: with World.Report set aside on both sides the digest is
// main's on all sixty days (checked again on top of #358).
// Again for #343 (HeatState.Trail and Investigation added to the walk;
// the move is on day 1 by shape alone and no number moved: with the two
// fields skipped the digest is the list before it on all sixty days,
// investigations shipping off).
// Again for #344 (Front.City added to the walk, stamped where a front
// is bought, and the fronts' roles): the move is on day 16, the boss's
// first front (the laundromat, which carries no effect), by shape
// alone; under harness.NoFrontRoles the digest is the file's to day 53
// and the roles first move a number on day 54, and cmd/balance -roles
// off prints main's trace to the dollar.
