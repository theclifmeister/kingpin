// TestSeedDigest (#144): the boss on one pinned seed, sixty days, the
// whole world hashed at the end of every one of them. A change that
// moves any number, any day, fails here and names the first day it
// moved, so a stream shift (a draw added to the home stream, a sim
// slotted between two others, a seed roll moved) or a balance change
// reads as one diff and not as a dozen medians, and a shape change (a
// field moved, a constructor reshaped) that claims to be byte-for-byte
// the old run has a test that says so. The failure prints the new
// list to paste in: a PR that moves a number pins the new one and
// names the day and the reason.
//
// The digest walks the world by reflection in a fixed order (struct
// fields in declaration order, map keys sorted), hashing every
// exported value; a float is rounded to six decimals first, so the
// fused multiply-add an arm64 build is allowed to use (Go's spec
// permits it; amd64 does not) cannot move the hash between a laptop
// and CI while a real change to any number does.

// FederalDecay, LawState.SnapElection and DayReport.Incident; day 25 by

// Stats.Earned and Invested, Today.Invested; no number moved: the boss's
// first level comes after day 60 on this seed).
// Again for #42 (the bought law on LawState, Route.Bought, Today.Bribes
// and Checkpoints, six Stats added to the walk; no number moved: with
// those fields skipped the digest is 0ab8bc7's on all sixty days, the
// boss paying nobody). Again for #195 (World.Offshore and QuietDays,
// Today.Reserved, Laundering.Structured, Stats.Reserved and Fees; one
// number moves from day 1: QuietDays, the count of quiet days in a row,
// which every run keeps and nothing but Retire reads; the boss reserves
// nothing by day 60 on this seed, holding under a campaign's worth).
// Again for #227 (World.Reign added to the walk; no number moved: with
// the field skipped the digest is the list before it on all sixty days,
// the boss holding no reign by day 60 on this seed).
// Again for #228 (Law.Favours, Law.FavourOwed and Stats.Favours in the
// walk; no number moved: with the fields skipped the digest is the list
// before it on all sixty days, the boss paying nobody by day 60 here).
// Again for #229 (World.War in the walk; no number moved: with the
// field skipped the digest is the list before it on all sixty days, the
// boss declaring no war).
// Again for #231 (Stats.Taxed in the walk; no number moved: with the
// field skipped the digest is the list before it on all sixty days, the
// boss holding no city by day 60).
// Again for #233, by copy alone, on day 56: the report's opening line
// under TIER the night the rival's push on the boss's front line was
// held off (World.Report is in the walk); with the report set aside the
// digest is the list before it on all sixty days, on both trees, and no

// Again for #43 (the table, on the duel's dice, harness.OneFaction:

// Home, Grudges, Trusts, Ally, Against, LostToYou, LastTakenBy,
// Absorbed, AbsorbedBy, Fragmented and Fragments, Deal, Offer,
// ScoutOrder, PoachOrder and Lead a Faction, CrewMember a Former and
// four Stats; the move is on day 1 by shape alone and no number moved:

// Again for #48 (World.Assets and AssetsLost, Today.AssetsBought,
// HeatState.TaskForceDay, WatchUntil, LineUntil and LineMul,
// Supplier.Owned, ShockUntil and ShockMul, six Stats added to the walk;
// one number moves from day 1: Stats.PeakClean, the clean high-water

// held; and the report's tier lines reword twice, `tier 2 of 5` on day
// 2 and tier 4's `Next` on day 54, the day this seed enters
// Distribution; with those set aside the digest is aea739e's on all
// sixty days before #43 and 8b22ab1's after it, so no money number
// moved: TestNoAssetIsTheOldRun reads the same day by day to the
// tier-4 checkpoint; re-pinned on the merged tree).
// Again for #194 (Corner.Deed, Today.DeedsBought, Law.Forfeited and
// four Stats; the move is on day 1 by shape alone and no number moved:
// the boss buys its first deed after day 100 on this seed, and

// the boss's trace holding to day 125 at the earliest).
// Again for #45 (World.Intel, Today.Cop and Spy, CrewMember.Undercover
// and UndercoverDay, DayReport.Intel and eight Stats added to the walk,
// RivalState.Known taken out of it and SchemaVersion 16; the move is on
// day 1 by shape alone and no number moved: with those fields set aside
// on both sides the digest is dff4a0a's on all sixty days, the boss
// paying no cop and planting nobody, and the facts the night writes off
// its own events living in Intel alone).
// Again for #49 (World.LegitDays, Ending.Who and Stats.Score added to
// the walk; the move is on day 1 by shape alone and no number moved:
// with the three fields skipped the digest is 2be03a7's on all sixty
// days, the boss's legit income under zero and nothing ending, and
// cmd/balance prints 2be03a7's trace to the dollar on boss, laundered
