// TestSeedDigest (#144): the boss on one pinned seed, sixty days, the
// whole world hashed at the end of every one of them. A change that
// moves any number, any day, fails here and names the first day it
// moved, so a stream shift (a draw added to the home stream, a sim
// slotted between two others, a seed roll moved) or a balance change
// reads as one diff and not as a dozen medians, and a shape change (a
// field moved, a constructor reshaped) that claims to be byte-for-byte
// the old run has a test that says so. The failure prints the new
// list to paste in: a PR that moves a number pins the new one and
// names the day and the reason.
//
// The digest walks the world by reflection in a fixed order (struct
// fields in declaration order, map keys sorted), hashing every
// exported value; a float is rounded to six decimals first, so the
// fused multiply-add an arm64 build is allowed to use (Go's spec
// permits it; amd64 does not) cannot move the hash between a laptop
// and CI while a real change to any number does.

// table boxed: day 1 moved by shape alone, five zero fields added,
// World.Incidents, RouteSetting.ClosedUntil, HeatState.FederalUntil and
// FederalDecay, LawState.SnapElection and DayReport.Incident; day 25 by

// Shipment.Quality, Supplier.Quality, Crew.Cooks and NextCook,
// Today.Cuts and five Stats added to the walk, the chemist beside the
// pool's faces once meth lists; the move is on day 1, the day the
// default quality and repeat_start are stamped, and no money number
// moved: t1 and t2 stand to the dollar and the boss's rows stand under
// #193's figures), and again for #192 (Front.Level, Invested and Grew,
// Stats.Earned and Invested, Today.Invested; no number moved: the boss's
// first level comes after day 60 on this seed).
// Again for #42 (the bought law on LawState, Route.Bought, Today.Bribes
// and Checkpoints, six Stats added to the walk; no number moved: with
// those fields skipped the digest is 0ab8bc7's on all sixty days, the
// boss paying nobody). Again for #195 (World.Offshore and QuietDays,
// Today.Reserved, Laundering.Structured, Stats.Reserved and Fees; one
// number moves from day 1: QuietDays, the count of quiet days in a row,
// which every run keeps and nothing but Retire reads; the boss reserves
// nothing by day 60 on this seed, holding under a campaign's worth).
// Again for #48 (World.Assets and AssetsLost, Today.AssetsBought,
// HeatState.TaskForceDay, WatchUntil, LineUntil and LineMul,
// Supplier.Owned, ShockUntil and ShockMul, six Stats added to the walk;
// one number moves from day 1: Stats.PeakClean, the clean high-water
// mark the assets unlock on, a copy of a maximum every run already
// held; and the report's tier lines reword twice, `tier 2 of 5` on day
// 2 and tier 4's `Next` on day 54, the day this seed enters
// Distribution; with those set aside the digest is aea739e's on all
// sixty days, so no money number moved: TestNoAssetIsTheOldRun reads
// the same day by day to the tier-4 checkpoint).
